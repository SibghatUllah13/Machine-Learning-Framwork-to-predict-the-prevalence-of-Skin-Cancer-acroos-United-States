To Run the Source Code,

1. Copy the File 'DE2.ipynb' present in the Folder 'Source Code' and paste it inside your working Directory.

2. Copy four folders from the Directory 'Data' and Paste them as they are inside your working Directory. Please Do not change the names of the folders.

We're also assuming that the OS is Windows. If you're working under some other OS, the path may be wrong and the code may not run successfuly.

3. Install the Package 'us' with the following command 

'pip3 install us'

4. We're assuming that Instructors have Python 3 installed.

5. The Source Code will run and produce the Results and Graphs necessary for the tasks involved.

6. In Any Case, Instructors can see the folder 'Figures' to understand the figures involved in the tasks. Tables and Figures are also present and discussed in the Report in Detail.

Thank you for your time.
